# What_Flower_Is_That
This is an image classification project for Udacity.  I used a pre-trained image classification model and added my own classifier at the end in order to customize it to the flower dataset I needed to predict.  This was constructed using PyTorch, and the model is able to predict flowers correctly 89% of the time.
